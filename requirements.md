## Vision

The Tea Explorer website addresses the consumer pain point of navigating the vast world of teas by providing a concise and informative platform featuring an interactive map. Users can click or hover over continents and countries to discover details about specialized teas. The inclusion of contact information on the second page streamlines the process for users interested in purchasing their preferred teas, offering a centralized source for information.

## Scope

### IN

- Provide information to the user about the different types of teas available throughout the world
- Display an interactive element to navigate the origin of teas on a world map
- Provide information to the user about each tea: more detailed description, purchase information
- Allow the user to search and filter of list of teas by different categories/properties
- Allow the user to "favorite" different teas to be stored on a reference list on each visit to the page
- Provide the user recommendations for teas based on their "favorite" teas list and other inputs

### OUT

- The web app will not be optimized for non-desktop devices like tablets and phones
- The web app will not list detailed information for every tea
