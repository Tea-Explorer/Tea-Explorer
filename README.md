## Description

***Work in Progress***

## Problem Domain

The Tea Explorer website addresses the consumer pain point of navigating the vast world of teas by providing a concise and informative platform featuring an interactive map. Users can click or hover over continents and countries to discover details about specialized teas. The inclusion of contact information on the second page streamlines the process for users interested in purchasing their preferred teas, offering a centralized source for information.
